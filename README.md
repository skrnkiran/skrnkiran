A data analyst with proven experience delivering analytics solutions that drive operational and strategic value.<br/>
I bring expertise in forecasting, KPI reporting, dashboard development, and automated reporting pipelines using SQL, Python, and BI tools including Power BI, Tableau and QuickSight.<br/> I translate raw, multi-source data into clear insights that inform decision-making, improve performance visibility, and solve real business problems. My work consistently reduces manual effort, strengthens data quality, and equips stakeholders at every level with reliable intelligence.
